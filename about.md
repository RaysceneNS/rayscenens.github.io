I'm Racine Ennis a software developer currently living in Calgary. Sometimes I make things and then write about them here.

I am a problem solver. I want to find out why things are the way they are. I want to understand how the world works, searching, asking questions, and delving into things.

After more than 20 years working on web related projects, I have an excellent knowledge of technologies, especially c#, JavaScript, html5. I know how to manage and participate in the software development life cycle.

I am communicative. I believe it is important to understand where a change request or idea is coming from as this can help to unearth the underlying business or technology driver. Often with this understanding I can work with the client to fine tune a requirement early on so that the business goal is achieved with less time or effort.

I am experienced. I've developed critical business systems using web technologies for many clients. These tools have helped to create real business value for the departments and companies that they are deployed in, from HR to Accounting, Sales to Operations. These solutions range in complexity from a dashboard of reports to a fully integrated suite of applications that distribute information between all facets of the organization in real time.

I am a learner and a teacher. I regularly read articles about improving software development. I am always looking for new tools and techniques for my personal toolbox and enjoy sharing this knowledge with others as well as learning from them.

I am passionate. I enjoy writing software and am lucky enough to call it both my profession as well as a hobby. In my free time I develop open source software and electronics.
